# Gesture-Recognition-Using-RNN
This project investigates gesture recognition techniques using Leap Motion Controller to collect 3 dimensional hand features such as coordinates, position of the hand, etc. We then use this raw data to train a Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network that is able to recognize basic hand gestures
